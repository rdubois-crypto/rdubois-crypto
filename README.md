# Background

Mathematician and Cryptographer interested in advanced cryptographic protocols, mainly relying on the use of pairings (zkp, broadcast encryption, ABE, Anonymous Credentials). Iâ€™m currently learning all the uses of previous protocols for Web3.0 applications (Self Sovereignty, Privacy preserving mechanisms).


# Current focus
- I optimize elliptic curves implementation in various environment (solidity, Cairo), this repo contains the fastest pure solidity implementation of EIP7212, EIP6565 and RIP7696
- I'm currently learning ZKP and Privacy mechanisms used in SSI and blockchains with a specific focus on Starks.
- I'm working a blockchain compatible version of ECDAA with linkability.
