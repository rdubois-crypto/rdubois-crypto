# Background

Mathematician and Cryptographer interested in advanced cryptographic protocols, (zkp, broadcast encryption, ABE, Anonymous Credentials). 


# Current focus
- I optimize lattice computations to protect Ethereum from Quantum threat, i cut cost for solidity and Cairo previous implementation by x20 and x8.
- I optimize elliptic curves implementation in various environment (solidity, Cairo), this repo contains the fastest pure solidity implementation of EIP7212, EIP6565 and RIP7696
- I implement MPC protocol to provide untrapdoorable wallet.
- I'm working a blockchain compatible version of ECDAA with linkability.
