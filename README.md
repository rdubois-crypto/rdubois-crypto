# Background

Mathematician and Cryptographer interested in advanced cryptographic protocols, mainly relying on the use of pairings (zkp, broadcast encryption, ABE, Anonymous Credentials). Iâ€™m currently learning all the uses of previous protocols for Web3.0 applications (Self Sovereignty, Privacy preserving mechanisms).


# Current focus
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on unification of cryptographic APIs, merging frameworks (libECC, Arkwork, blst, lib256zkp). Related project is the cylib repo (quite an empty shell for now)
- I'm currently writting a survey on ZKP and Privacy mechanisms used in SSI and blockchains, the aim is to speed up understanding for a crypto moving from traditional cybersecurity to Blockchain framework. It is also because it helps me to write thing down as i go deep inside the different primitves and implementations.
