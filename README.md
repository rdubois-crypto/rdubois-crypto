- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdubois-crypto
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced cryptographic protocols, mainly relying on the use of pairings (zkp, broadcast encryption, ABE, Anonymous Credentials)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the uses of previous protocols for Web3.0 applications (Self Sovereignty, Privacy preserving mechanisms)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on unification of cryptographic APIs, merging frameworks (libECC, Arkwork, blst, lib256zkp)
- 📫 How to reach me :
